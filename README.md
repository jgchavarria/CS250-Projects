CS 250 – Sprint Review and Retrospective
Portfolio Reflection

This repository includes my Sprint Review and Retrospective from CS 250. 
This project allowed me to apply Agile and Scrum practices in a structured development environment and reflect on how teams collaborate to deliver working software.

Essential Questions Reflection
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs starts with understanding the problem from the user’s perspective. 
Instead of immediately thinking about code, I focus on what the user is trying to accomplish. 
Creating user stories helps break down those needs into smaller, manageable pieces. 
A user story clearly defines who the user is, what they want, and why they need it.

For example, writing a story like, “As a traveler, I want to search for destinations so that I can compare prices,” helps guide development. 
It keeps the focus on functionality and value rather than technical details. 
User stories also include acceptance criteria, which clarify what must be true for the feature to be considered complete. 
This makes development more structured and reduces misunderstandings.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I approach developing programs by breaking large problems into smaller tasks. 
Agile has helped me understand the importance of iterative development. 
Instead of trying to build everything at once, I now see the value in working in short sprints, testing frequently, and adjusting based on feedback.

In the future, I hope to continue using:

- Sprint planning to organize tasks clearly

- Daily stand-ups to improve communication

- Sprint reviews to demonstrate progress

- Retrospectives to reflect and improve

- Backlogs to prioritize work effectively

Agile encourages flexibility and continuous improvement, which I believe are essential in software development because requirements often change.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating clearly, meeting deadlines, and being open to feedback. 
It also means supporting teammates and taking responsibility for your work. 
In Scrum, each role contributes differently, but collaboration is what makes the team successful.

A good team member listens actively, asks questions when something is unclear, and speaks up when there are concerns. 
Transparency and accountability are important. 
I have learned that strong communication and trust within a team can significantly improve the quality of the final product.

Final Reflection

This course helped me better understand how Agile and Scrum support organized, flexible software development. 
The Sprint Review and Retrospective allowed me to evaluate both the product and the team process. 
Moving forward in my Computer Science program and future career, I plan to apply these Agile principles to improve collaboration, adaptability, and overall software quality.
